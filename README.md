🔹 Key Architecture Decisions
	•	Component-based sections for clarity and reusability
	•	Single-page layout with smooth scrolling
	•	Framer Motion used only where animations add value
	•	Inline styles for better control and faster iteration
	•	Consistent spacing & typography across all sections

🔹 Each section is self-contained, making it easy to:
	•	Modify
	•	Extend
	•	Reuse in future projects
