    <BlogLayout title="APIs deserve as much attention as UI">
      <p>
        APIs are the backbone of modern applications. When APIs break, the entire
        system becomes unreliable, even if the UI looks fine.
      </p>

      <p>
        API testing helps catch issues early, reduces dependency on UI automation,
        and provides faster feedback during development.
      </p>

      <p>
        A strong API test strategy leads to more stable systems and faster
        end-to-end test execution.
