        Quality is not owned by QA alone. It is a shared responsibility across
        developers, testers, product managers, and designers.
      </p>

      <p>
        When testing is introduced early and discussed openly, defects are caught
        faster and feedback loops become shorter.
      </p>

      <p>
        The most successful teams treat testing as a mindset, not a phase at the
        end of development.
